# UPS Shutdown Shell Script

## Introduction

A simple bash script that remotely shuts down servers via SSH upon being executed.

We have a pretty large APC UPS and are running Mac and Linux servers, the UPS only has the option for one signal cable which is currently attached to our main server. This script can be used instead of purchasing an additional expansion card to hook up additional servers.

This script can be merged/replace the default script located at: /usr/libexec/upsshutdown (Mac OS X)
